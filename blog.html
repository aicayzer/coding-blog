	<h2>Welcome. Welcome to the blog.</h2>

	<p class="quote">
	Welcome. I learnt to code around a year ago. I learnt using any free content I could find on the internet; be it using blog posts or Codecademy. What struck me as I went along is there was a lack of documentation about what to learn/do and why. I found myself learning things because I just thought it would be useful to know. This was fine initially as learning HTML, CSS and Javascript is a pretty solid base. Beyond that, I struggled for a bit. </p>

	<p>	You see once you’ve learnt these languages and created a few websites you reach a huge decision. Do you proceed doing this or do you learn new languages, which ones, where and how do you test yourself. This last point was the most interesting for me. With the frontend trio (HTML, CSS and Javascript) you can just create websites which gradually increase in difficulty and size but with other languages with Python, it’s tricky to find challenges for a beginner. Sure if you are a pro there is enough things to do it would require multiple life times but if you’re not, well…</p>

	<p>	So this “blog” aims to set out languages worth learning, why, how to learn and how to test yourself. I hope you enjoy…</p>
