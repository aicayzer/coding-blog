		<h2>Another side note - Python Challenges</h2>

		<p class="quote">	This is going to be another relatively short post. I am currently away on holiday so I am just picking things which I know won't take to long to write about. Nevertheless, this is about Python.</p>

		<p>	Python is an awsome language which I will write about in a later blog post. When I first learnt Python I found it very easy to forget certain terms and I struggled briefly when I couldn't find a really good way of practicing whilst enjoying writing Python. Then a friend told me about <a class="link" href="https://projecteuler.net/archives">Project Euler - see here</a>. I still use Project Euler avidly. It is a great testing platform. There are also other Python challenges you can do. Here are a few of them. </p>

				<li><a class="link" href="https://coderbyte.com/">Coderbyte - click heres</a></li>
			</ol>

			<p>	To be honest. All you really need to do is Google "Python challenges" and there are hundreads of results. I really recomend you attempt these challenges as it is a good way of measuring you abilites and it helps to practice manipulating data which is really important and something a job you have in later life may entail. </p>

		<h2>A little side note - Atom</h2>

		<p class="quote">	A little note about Atom. Atom is a text editor which I really recomend. It is similar to Sublime in almost  every way but having tried both I find Atom just has a marginally better UI. Nevertheless, if you are using Sublime you can't go wrong and I am not going to persuade you to switch over to Atom. </p>

<p>	I want to discuss this very briefly. Atom works brilliantly with the termianl (NB when you dowload it you just have to install the shell commands by clicking on Atom in the top right hand corner and then "install shell comands"). There are thousands of really good packages which make it far more efficient - <a class="link" href="https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/best-atom-packages-2017/">see here</a>. The ability to push to github from Atom is great. The list goes on but in general, Atom just offers a very efficient way to write code.</p>

<p>(THIS IS NOT A PAID ENDORSEMENT)</p>

		<h2>Practice</h2>

		<p class="quote">	Hello again! Today I want to discuss something a little different from the previous two posts (I touched on it a little in the last post). What I want to discuss is practice. Practice is key. Practice may seem obvious and practically every course on the internet you do will involve you writing your own code. This isn’t enough though because it just requires short term memory most of the time and that is useless in the long run. </p>

		<p>	Before I progress any further, I just want to address those of you readers who are considering skipping this post and suggest you don’t. I know you’ll think practicing is easy, and it is, but in reality not that many people actually bother from my experience. </p>

		<p>	First why practice? There is the obvious reason of it helps you move things from long term to short term memory but actually there are a lot of good reasons. One of these is that you’ll often find you have forgotten what you have just learnt. When I first started coding I was pretty confident that I had picked up everything I had learnt and after about a week or so an arrogant voice in my head was telling me I basically knew everything there was to know about HTML and CSS; oh how wrong I was. You see when I tried to code my first website independently of any course about two weeks in and I went to write “<!DOCTYPE html>” I couldn’t. I was so used to Codecademy pre-writing it I literally didn’t even know how to tell the computer I was writing in HTML. THIS IS A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE OF WHY PRACTICE IS KEY!! So, in short, practice is good because often you assume you know things when you don’t really know them. </p>

		<p>	Reason 2: It makes you use StackOverflow. After realising in the above example that I had forgotten how to write the fist line of HTML, the first thing I did was go to StackOverflow and no surprises, the answer was there. This was pretty easy to find on StackOverflow but as I have mentioned before it is good to “practice” using stack as it is such a large data base and if you have never used it before and you try and find something relatively complicated of the bat it is surprisingly tricky. I have only addressed StackOverflow here but this is applicable to trying to find anything on google when it comes to coding. </p>

		<p>	Reason 3: You learn more as you practice. When I went to code my first site, I realised I didn’t know how to set a picture as the background (and nor should I have as it hadn’t come up in my course yet) but I still wanted to do it. So, a quick Google search and I found the code and to this day I remember how to set a picture as the background. This is just one example of many. </p>

		<p>	Reason 4: You develop references. Often when I am coding now and I can’t remember something I don’t go straight to Google, I go to websites which I have created in the past where I know I have written the term I am trying to think of. Obviously I could find the answer online but this is a much easier and quicker way to find what I am looking for often. </p>

		<p>	(Semi-)Reason 5: It get’s you excited about coding when you have just started. When you just start learning to code it is easy to lose interest as you learn lists and tables but the second you actually create a functioning website it gives you a whole new kick about coding.  </p>

		<p>	So briefly, how to practice? Well I have sort of covered that in the above but… just set yourself a target be it to code a basic photo site or to write a python script for rock paper scissors and do it. </p> SIMPLE!

		<h2>The Greatest.</h2>

		<p class="quote">
			Hello again! Today I want to address the next step I took. This step was from <a class="link" href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> to <a class="link" href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a>. Spoiler, <a class="link" href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a> is great. Really great. The greatest. </p>

		<p>	First, I want to address what <a class="link" href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a> is. <a class="link" href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/">Web Developer Bootcamp</a> is a website where you can do courses. These courses range from photography to web developer bootcamps. The latter is what I was interested in. The courses are usually about £10/$11 (They are always 90% off, do not be fooled). Most of the web development ones are 40+ hours and it is essentially university style teaching. You watch, take notes, practice and then test yourself. </p>

		<p> So, why do I think this is good? I think it is good for a few reasons. The first is very simple and a little personal. I liked having a teacher who would point out key information as opposed to having to read endless pages of <a class="link" href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/">Web Developer Bootcamp</a> about it. I also found it easier to focus with a teacher as often I was learning late at night after school and my attention span was quite short by that point! The second reason is similar to the first reason. You can go at your own pace by changing the playback speed from 1x - 2x and you can easily skip out lectures which seem relativly basic/you already know about. This is really important as it means you can learn a lot in a short amount of time. Something which isn't true with <a class="link" href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/">Web Developer Bootcamp</a>. Finally, once you have bought the course it is yours. Yours forever. Unlike other sites like <a class="link" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/">Treehouse</a>. This means you can always go back to a lecture if you are having a problem and I now personally use it as my go to (after StackOverflow) if I can't remember how to do something. </p>

		For those of you who this interests. I really recommend Colt Steel. I did the course he has on <a class="link" href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/">Web Developer Bootcamp</a> and it was fantastic. I would first do the <a class="link" href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/">Web Developer Bootcamp</a> and then either the advanced one after or move onto his other ones such as Python (I am going to come back to this in a future post). Click <a class="link" href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/">here</a> to see the <a class="link" href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/">Web Developer Bootcamp</a> to see that specific course.

		So, what can be learnt here? I REALLY recommend <a class="link" href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/">Web Developer Bootcamp</a> and Colt's course in particular - it is the only basic web developer bootcamp I have done on there so I can't vouch for any others. However, I do want to mention something at this point. It is all very well learning but you must practice. This is what the next post will be on. Stay tuned for the next post. </p>

		<h2>Welcome back!!</h2>

		<p class="quote">
			Welcome to post two. Here I am going to address my jump into the programming world and how I first started, part 1. </p>

		<p> At first, I started using <a class="link" href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a>. This was great as it really wetted my appetite for coding and the beauty of what you can create with just a few lines out code. </p>
		<p>The positives of <a class="link" href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> for me were:
			<ul>
				<li> You learn good syntax and formalities. What I mean by this is you learn a good way to structure your code which is so important if you ever want to collaborate or write long scripts. </li>
				<li> The course content is really good. It makes sure you learn the essentials in the right order and someone has clearly spend a lot of time creating the syllabus</li>
				<li> <a class="link" href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> is a company which makes money. It therefore has to compete with other “learn to code” sites so it must differentiate itself and it must be the best. In order to do this it keeps updating the syllabus as new iterations of languages come
					out. This is great as there is no point in learning outdated code.</li>
				<li> <a class="link" href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> just has a good user interface (UI). There is no denying it. It is easy to navigate and easy to understand </li>
			</ul>

			<p> The negatives are:
				<ul>
					<li> It is slow moving. There is no getting around that. </li>
					<li> There will come a time when you want to branch out and begin to learn marginally more specialised things. This may not be the right way to put it. What I mean is that you may want to learn more about creating a toolbar than how to write a list. You can skip forwards but they often will try and make you practice the skills you have already learnt. </li>
					<li> Finally, it doesn't teach you the most valuable coding skill in my opinion. Googling things. This may seem stupid as everyone is capable of using Google (or some other web browser). You will have had to use it to get here. But looking for more specific things on Google requires a little bit more competence. You need to be able to be very specific in a very short amount of words to find the references you are looking for regarding your problem - 95% of the time the answer will be somewhere on StackOverflow. </p> </ul>
				<p>So do I recommend <a class="link" href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a>. Yes and no. What I mean by this is, like said previously, it is great to wet your appetite for coding but not great past then as you ended up waisting time and you will become bored with something which
					is most certainly not a boring subject.</li>
			</p>

		<h2>Welcome. Welcome to the blog.</h2>

		<p class="quote">
		Welcome. I learnt to code around a year ago. I learnt using any free content I could find on the internet; be it using blog posts or <a class="link" href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a>. What struck me as I went along is there was a lack of documentation about what to learn/do and why. I found myself learning things because I just thought it would be useful to know. This was fine initially as learning HTML, CSS and Javascript is a pretty solid base. Beyond that, I struggled for a bit. </p>

		<p> You see once you’ve learnt these languages and created a few websites you reach a huge decision. Do you proceed doing this or do you learn new languages, which ones, where and how do you test yourself. This last point was the most interesting for me. With the frontend trio (HTML, CSS and Javascript) you can just create websites which gradually increase in difficulty and size but with other languages with Python, it’s tricky to find challenges for a beginner. Sure if you are a pro there is enough things to do it would require multiple lifetimes but if you’re not, well…</p>

		<p> So this “blog” aims to set out languages worth learning, why, how to learn and how to test yourself. I hope you enjoy…</p>
