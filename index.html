			Hello again! Today I want to address the next step I took. This step was from Codecademy to Udemy. Spoiler, Udemy is great. Really great. The greatest.

			Welcome to post two. Here I am going to address my jump into the programming world and how I first started, part 1. </p>

		<p> At first, I started using Codecademy (https://www.codecademy.com/). This was great as it really wetted my appetite for coding and the beauty of what you can create with just a few lines out code. </p>
		<p>The positives of Codecademy for me were:
			<ul>
				<li> You learn good syntax and formalities. What I mean by this is you learn a good way to structure your code which is so important if you ever want to collaborate or write long scripts. </li>
				<li> The course content is really good. It makes sure you learn the essentials in the right order and someone has clearly spend a lot of time creating the syllabus</li>
				<li> Codecademy is a company which makes money. It is therefore has to compete with other “learn to code” sites so it must differentiate itself and it must be the best. In order to do this it keeps updating the syllabus as new iterations of languages come
					out. This is great as there is no point in learning outdated code.</li>
				<li> Codecademy just has a good user interface (UI). There is no denying it. It is easy to navigate and easy to understand </li>
			</ul>

			<p> The negatives are:
				<ul>
					<li> It is slow moving. There is no getting around that. </li>
					<li> There will come a time when you want to branch out and begin to learn marginally more specialised things. This may not be the right way to put it. What I mean is that you may want to learn more about creating a toolbar than how to write a list. You
						can skip forwards but they often will try and make you practice the skills you have already learnt. </li>
					<li> Finally, it doesn't teach you the most valuable coding skill in my opinion. Googling things. This may seem stupid as everyone is capable of using Google (or some other web browser). You will have had to use it to get here. But looking for more specific
						things on Google requires a little bit more competance. You need to be able to be very specific in a very short ammount of words to find the references you are looking for regarding your problem - 95% of the time the answer will be somewhere on
						StackOverflow. So do I recomend Codecademy. Yes and no. What I mean by this is, like said previously, it is great to wet your appetite for coding but not great past then as you ended up waisting time and you will become bored with something which
						is most certainly not a boring subject.</li>

		<h2>Welcome. Welcome to the blog.</h2>

			Welcome. I learnt to code around a year ago. I learnt using any free content I could find on the internet; be it using blog posts or Codecademy. What struck me as I went along is there was a lack of documentation about what to learn/do and why. I found
			myself learning things because I just thought it would be useful to know. This was fine initially as learning HTML, CSS and Javascript is a pretty solid base. Beyond that, I struggled for a bit. </p>

		<p> You see once you’ve learnt these languages and created a few websites you reach a huge decision. Do you proceed doing this or do you learn new languages, which ones, where and how do you test yourself. This last point was the most interesting for me.
			With the frontend trio (HTML, CSS and Javascript) you can just create websites which gradually increase in difficulty and size but with other languages with Python, it’s tricky to find challenges for a beginner. Sure if you are a pro there is enough
			things to do it would require multiple life times but if you’re not, well…</p>

		<p> So this “blog” aims to set out languages worth learning, why, how to learn and how to test yourself. I hope you enjoy…</p>
