		<h2>The Greatest.</h2>

		<p class="quote">
			Hello again! Today I want to address the next step I took. This step was from <a class="link" href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> to <a class="link" href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a>. Spoiler, <a class="link" href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a> is great. Really great. The greatest. </p>

		<p>	First, I want to address what <a class="link" href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a> is. <a class="link" href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/">Web Developer Bootcamp</a> is a website where you can do courses. These courses range from photography to web developer bootcamps. The latter is what I was interested in. The courses are usually about £10/$11 (They are always 90% off, do not be fooled). Most of the web development ones are 40+ hours and it is essentially university style teaching. You watch, take notes, practice and then test yourself. </p>

		<p> So, why do I think this is good? I think it is good for a few reasons. The first is very simple and a little personal. I liked having a teacher who would point out key information as opposed to having to read endless pages of <a class="link" href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/">Web Developer Bootcamp</a> about it. I also found it easier to focus with a teacher as often I was learning late at night after school and my attention span was quite short by that point! The second reason is similar to the first reason. You can go at your own pace by changing the playback speed from 1x - 2x and you can easily skip out lectures which seem relativly basic/you already know about. This is really important as it means you can learn a lot in a short amount of time. Something which isn't true with <a class="link" href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/">Web Developer Bootcamp</a>. Finally, once you have bought the course it is yours. Yours forever. Unlike other sites like <a class="link" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/">Treehouse</a>. This means you can always go back to a lecture if you are having a problem and I now personally use it as my go to (after StackOverflow) if I can't remember how to do something. </p>

		For those of you who this interests. I really recommend Colt Steel. I did the course he has on <a class="link" href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/">Web Developer Bootcamp</a> and it was fantastic. I would first do the <a class="link" href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/">Web Developer Bootcamp</a> and then either the advanced one after or move onto his other ones such as Python (I am going to come back to this in a future post). Click <a class="link" href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/">here</a> to see the <a class="link" href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/">Web Developer Bootcamp</a> to see that specific course.

		So, what can be learnt here? I REALLY recommend <a class="link" href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/">Web Developer Bootcamp</a> and Colt's course in particular - it is the only basic web developer bootcamp I have done on there so I can't vouch for any others. However, I do want to mention something at this point. It is all very well learning but you must practice. This is what the next post will be on. Stay tuned for the next post.

		<h2>Welcome back!!</h2>

		<p class="quote">
			Welcome to post two. Here I am going to address my jump into the programming world and how I first started, part 1. </p>

		<p> At first, I started using <a class="link" href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a>. This was great as it really wetted my appetite for coding and the beauty of what you can create with just a few lines out code. </p>
		<p>The positives of <a class="link" href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> for me were:
			<ul>
				<li> You learn good syntax and formalities. What I mean by this is you learn a good way to structure your code which is so important if you ever want to collaborate or write long scripts. </li>
				<li> The course content is really good. It makes sure you learn the essentials in the right order and someone has clearly spend a lot of time creating the syllabus</li>
				<li> <a class="link" href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> is a company which makes money. It therefore has to compete with other “learn to code” sites so it must differentiate itself and it must be the best. In order to do this it keeps updating the syllabus as new iterations of languages come
					out. This is great as there is no point in learning outdated code.</li>
				<li> <a class="link" href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> just has a good user interface (UI). There is no denying it. It is easy to navigate and easy to understand </li>
			</ul>

			<p> The negatives are:
				<ul>
					<li> It is slow moving. There is no getting around that. </li>
					<li> There will come a time when you want to branch out and begin to learn marginally more specialised things. This may not be the right way to put it. What I mean is that you may want to learn more about creating a toolbar than how to write a list. You can skip forwards but they often will try and make you practice the skills you have already learnt. </li>
					<li> Finally, it doesn't teach you the most valuable coding skill in my opinion. Googling things. This may seem stupid as everyone is capable of using Google (or some other web browser). You will have had to use it to get here. But looking for more specific things on Google requires a little bit more competence. You need to be able to be very specific in a very short amount of words to find the references you are looking for regarding your problem - 95% of the time the answer will be somewhere on StackOverflow. </p> </ul>
				<p>So do I recommend <a class="link" href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a>. Yes and no. What I mean by this is, like said previously, it is great to wet your appetite for coding but not great past then as you ended up waisting time and you will become bored with something which
					is most certainly not a boring subject.</li>
			</p>

		<h2>Welcome. Welcome to the blog.</h2>

		<p class="quote">
		Welcome. I learnt to code around a year ago. I learnt using any free content I could find on the internet; be it using blog posts or <a class="link" href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a>. What struck me as I went along is there was a lack of documentation about what to learn/do and why. I found myself learning things because I just thought it would be useful to know. This was fine initially as learning HTML, CSS and Javascript is a pretty solid base. Beyond that, I struggled for a bit. </p>

		<p> You see once you’ve learnt these languages and created a few websites you reach a huge decision. Do you proceed doing this or do you learn new languages, which ones, where and how do you test yourself. This last point was the most interesting for me. With the frontend trio (HTML, CSS and Javascript) you can just create websites which gradually increase in difficulty and size but with other languages with Python, it’s tricky to find challenges for a beginner. Sure if you are a pro there is enough things to do it would require multiple lifetimes but if you’re not, well…</p>

		<p> So this “blog” aims to set out languages worth learning, why, how to learn and how to test yourself. I hope you enjoy…</p>
